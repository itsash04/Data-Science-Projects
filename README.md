# *🧠 Data Science Projects Repository*
Welcome to my Data Science Repository! This collection showcases a range of projects that demonstrate my skills and experience in data exploration, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. From Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to unsupervised learning techniques like clustering, and foundational AI methods such as gradient descent — this repository is designed to reflect real-world problem-solving with data.
# *🔍 Highlights
*📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)*
Visual and statistical inspection of datasets.

Techniques used: heatmaps, correlation matrices, boxplots, missing value treatment, and more.

Projects include domain-specific EDA (e.g., retail, healthcare).

*🤖 Machine Learning & Data Science Techniques*
Clustering Algorithms: K-Means, Agglomerative, DBSCAN with silhouette analysis.

Dimensionality Reduction: Principal Component Analysis (PCA), t-SNE.

Visualizations to interpret model output and data grouping.

*🧠 AI Approaches & Optimization*
Implemented Gradient Descent (Batch, Stochastic, Mini-Batch) from scratch.

Built simple linear/logistic regression models using gradient-based optimization.

Intuition-first explanations supported by code and plots.

#*⚙️ Tools & Technologies
Languages: Python

Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

Jupyter Notebooks for interactive analysis

Version Control: Git


# *📚 Future Plans
Add more AI optimization techniques (e.g., Adam, RMSprop).

Include supervised ML projects (classification, regression).

Develop a full pipeline project with deployment.
