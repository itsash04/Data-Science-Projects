# 🎬 Movie Recommendation System using Intelligent Clustering and Hugging Face API

## 📡 Dynamic Clustering Ecosystem Powered by Swarm Intelligence & Hugging Face

Welcome to the **Multimodal Movie Recommendation System** — a cutting-edge project that combines **natural language understanding**, **swarm intelligence**, and **dynamic clustering** to deliver **personalized and diverse movie recommendations**.

This system leverages **multimodal data** (textual metadata, embeddings, user preferences), uses the **Hugging Face API** for semantic understanding, and organizes recommendations using a **dynamic clustering ecosystem** driven by **swarm intelligence principles**.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

* **Goal**: To build a scalable and intelligent recommendation system that adapts dynamically to user preferences by leveraging semantic embeddings and optimized clustering.
* **Methodology**:

  * Semantic feature extraction using Hugging Face Transformers.
  * Swarm intelligence algorithms (e.g., Ant Colony Optimization, Particle Swarm Optimization) for adaptive clustering.
  * Evaluation using advanced cluster validity metrics.

---

## 🧠 Key Features

* 🔍 **Multimodal Input**: Processes both metadata (title, genre, plot) and user interaction signals.
* 🧬 **Semantic Embeddings**: Utilizes Hugging Face Transformers (BERT, RoBERTa, etc.) for deep contextual understanding of movie content.
* 🐜 **Swarm Intelligence**: Applies nature-inspired algorithms to form and evolve clusters dynamically.
* 🧭 **Dynamic Ecosystem**: Clusters evolve based on interaction history and semantic drift.
* 🎯 **Personalized Recommendations**: Suggests movies based on semantic proximity and cluster cohesion.

## 🧪 Performance Metrics

The system is evaluated using robust clustering and recommendation metrics:

| Metric                                     | Description                                                                                             |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Davies-Bouldin Index**                   | Measures cluster compactness and separation (lower is better).                                          |
| **Silhouette Score**                       | Evaluates how similar an object is to its own cluster vs. others (range: -1 to 1).                      |
| **CDGB (Cluster-Driven Gain in Behavior)** | A custom metric to evaluate how much user satisfaction or relevance improves due to dynamic clustering. |

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Programming Language**: Python
* **NLP Models**: Hugging Face Transformers (BERT, RoBERTa, DistilBERT)
* **Optimization**: Swarm Intelligence (ACO, PSO)
* **Libraries**: `scikit-learn`, `transformers`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `pandas`
* **Visualization**: Seaborn, Matplotlib for cluster maps and metric plots

---

## 📊 Sample Results

* **Davies-Bouldin Score**: *0.47* (low → good cluster separation)
* **Silhouette Score**: *0.61* (moderate to strong cohesion)
* **CDGB Improvement**: *+28%* increase in relevance over static KMeans-based baseline

## 🧬 How It Works (Pipeline)

1. **Preprocessing**: Clean and tokenize movie plots and metadata.
2. **Embedding Extraction**: Generate embeddings using Hugging Face models.
3. **Swarm Optimization**: Clusters form based on semantic similarity and swarm heuristics.
4. **Evaluation & Evolution**: Continuously monitor clusters using metrics and evolve structure.
5. **Recommendation**: Recommend top-N movies closest to the user profile vector within optimal clusters.
